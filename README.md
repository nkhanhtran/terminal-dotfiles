Here is the backup for my terminal dotfiles.

The backup includes configuration for zsh, vim, git and jshint.

gitconfig contains git global information and should be changed if used by other but not the owner of this project.

The following should be installed for a fresh computer:

```sudo apt-get install zsh vim git python-pip nodejs npm fakeroot quilt debhelper```

```npm install jshint```

```chsh -s /bin/zsh```

To install:

```git clone --recursive git://github.com/nkhanhtran/terminal-dotfiles.git```

```cd terminal-dotfiles```

```sh install.sh```
