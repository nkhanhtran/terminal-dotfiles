Here is the backup for my terminal dotfiles.

The project includes configuration for zsh, vim and git.

gitconfig contains git global information and should be changed if used by other but not the owner of this project.

To install:
```git clone --recursive git@github.com:nkhanhtran/terminal-dotfiles.git```\n
```cd terminal-dotfiles```\n
```sh install.sh```\n
