Here is the backup for my terminal dotfiles.

The backup includes configurations for most used terminal programs on my lappy.

gitconfig contains git global information and should be changed if used by other but not me.

The following should be installed in order to make this backup works: 

```sudo apt-get install zsh vim git python-pip```

To install:

```git clone --recursive git://github.com/nkhanhtran/terminal-dotfiles.git```

```cd terminal-dotfiles```

```sh install.sh```
